### sanity
Let's perform a simple **sanity** check and compute the performance of the model using Root Squared Mean Error (RSME) metric. (mentally healthy)

### paramount
As models grow in complexity, interpretability becomes **paramount**. Captum is PyTorchâ€™s response to this need, offering model interpretability and understanding tools for deep learning. (very important)
